## How to Play Rigs of Rods
 
Now that you have downloaded and installed the 0.38 content pack, you might be wondering how to play Rigs of Rods. The game is very easy to start, but it can be challenging to master. Here are some tips and tricks to help you enjoy the game.
 
First, you need to launch Rigs of Rods from your desktop or start menu. You will see a main menu with several options. You can choose to start a single player game, join a multiplayer game, create a new vehicle or terrain, edit an existing one, or change the settings. You can also access the documentation and the forum from the menu.
 
If you want to start a single player game, you need to select a terrain and a vehicle from the list. You can use the filters to narrow down your choices. You can also preview the terrain and the vehicle before loading them. Once you have made your selection, click on Start.
 
You will then see a loading screen with some useful information about the terrain and the vehicle. You can also see the controls for driving, flying or sailing your vehicle. You can change the controls from the settings menu if you want. You can also use a joystick or a steering wheel if you have one.
 
When the game starts, you will see your vehicle in the terrain. You can use the mouse to look around and the keyboard to control your vehicle. You can also use the F1-F12 keys to switch between different camera views. You can press Esc to pause the game and access the menu.
 
The game is very realistic and physics-based, so you need to be careful with your vehicle. If you crash or damage your vehicle, it will deform and affect its performance. You can also detach parts of your vehicle or attach them to other vehicles using ropes or hooks. You can also spawn more vehicles or change your vehicle from the menu.
 
The game has no specific goals or missions, so you can do whatever you want in the game. You can explore the terrain, perform stunts, race with other vehicles, transport cargo, rescue people, or just have fun. The game is very open-ended and sandbox-like, so you can create your own scenarios and challenges.
