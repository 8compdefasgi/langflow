## How to Master the Game with Tips and Tricks
 
Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is not only a great story-driven game, but also a challenging one. You will face many enemies, puzzles, and moral dilemmas along your journey. To help you overcome these obstacles and become a true Jedi or Sith master, here are some tips and tricks you should know:

- Talk to every character. Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a dialogue-heavy game, and much of its world and lore is revealed through conversations with NPCs. Talking to everyone can also give you valuable information, hints, side quests, rewards, and alignment points. Don't forget to talk to your companions as well, as they can offer insights, advice, and even romance options.
- Choose the class that suits your preferred playstyle. At the beginning of the game, you can choose between three classes: Scoundrel, Soldier, and Scout. Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses, and will affect your skills, feats, attributes, and progression. The Scoundrel is good at stealth, persuasion, and critical hits. The Soldier is good at combat, health, and defense. The Scout is good at balance, technology, and implants. Choose wisely according to how you want to play the game.
- Select the right attributes. Attributes are the core stats that determine your character's abilities and performance. There are six attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each one affects different aspects of the game, such as damage, accuracy, health, skills, force powers, and dialogue options. You can distribute points among these attributes when you create your character and when you level up. You should focus on the attributes that match your class and playstyle.
- Learn the right skills. Skills are the abilities that allow you to perform various actions in the game, such as hacking computers, disarming mines, healing wounds, unlocking doors, and persuading people. There are eight skills: Computer Use, Demolitions, Stealth, Awareness, Persuade, Repair, Security, and Treat Injury. You can allocate points to these skills when you level up. You should learn the skills that are useful for your class and playstyle.
- Maximize your build with feats. Feats are special abilities that grant you bonuses or new options in combat or exploration. There are many feats to choose from in Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic: some are general feats that anyone can learn; some are class-specific feats that only certain classes can learn; some are weapon-specific feats that only apply to certain weapons; some are force feats that only apply to force users; and some are special feats that are granted by certain events or items. You can select one feat every few levels when you level up. You should pick the feats that complement your class and playstyle.
- Save often (or right before something big happens). Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a game where your choices matter and have consequences. Sometimes these consequences can be irreversible or undesirable. To avoid regretting your decisions or losing progress due to bugs or crashes, you should save often and create multiple save files. You should especially save before making important choices or facing tough enemies or bosses.

Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a game that rewards exploration, experimentation, and customization. By following these tips and tricks, you can make the most out of your adventure and become a legend in the galaxy.
