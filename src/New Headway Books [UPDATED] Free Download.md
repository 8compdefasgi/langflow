## Download New Headway Books from Other Websites
 
If you don't have an access code or you want to download other New Headway books that are not available on the official website, you can try some other websites that offer free downloads of English language textbooks. However, you need to be careful when using these websites, as some of them may contain viruses, malware, or illegal content. Here are some tips to avoid these risks:

- Check the reputation of the website: You can use tools like Google Safe Browsing or Web of Trust to see if the website has a good or bad reputation among other users. You can also read reviews and comments from other people who have used the website before.
- Check the format and size of the file: You should only download files that are in PDF or EPUB format, as these are the most common formats for ebooks. You should also check the size of the file and make sure it matches the expected size of the book. If the file is too small or too large, it may be corrupted or contain unwanted content.
- Scan the file before opening it: You should always scan any file that you download from the internet with a reliable antivirus software before opening it. This will help you detect and remove any potential threats that may harm your device or your privacy.
