## Troubleshooting Tips for Grundig WiFi USB Dongle
 
If you encounter any problems with using the Grundig WiFi USB Dongle, here are some tips to help you solve them:

- Make sure the dongle is inserted firmly into the USB port on your TV. If the dongle is loose or not connected properly, it may not work or cause errors.

- If none of the above tips work, you can try resetting the dongle by unplugging it from your TV and plugging it back in after a few seconds. You can also try resetting your TV by unplugging it from the power source and plugging it back in after a few minutes.
