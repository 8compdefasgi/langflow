If you are a fan of Celine Dion, you probably know her album Let's Talk About Love, released in 1997. It is one of the best-selling albums of all time, with over 31 million copies sold worldwide. It features some of her most iconic songs, such as "My Heart Will Go On", "Immortality", and "Tell Him". But did you know that you can enjoy this pop masterpiece in FLAC format?
 
FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, which is a type of audio compression that preserves the original quality of the sound. Unlike MP3 or AAC, which reduce the file size by discarding some data, FLAC compresses the audio without any loss of information. This means that you can hear every detail and nuance of Celine Dion's voice and music, as if you were listening to the CD or even better.

FLAC files are compatible with many devices and players, such as VLC, Foobar2000, Winamp, and more. You can also convert them to other formats if you need to. However, FLAC files are usually larger than MP3 or AAC files, so you might need more storage space and bandwidth to download and play them.
