One of the main features of Adobe After Effects CC 2015.3 v13.8.1 Final Active (Rootdorid) Full Version is the GPU-accelerated effects. These are effects that can use the power of your graphics card to render faster and more efficiently. Some of the GPU-accelerated effects are:

- Gaussian Blur: This effect blurs the pixels of a layer using a Gaussian function. It can be used to create depth of field, motion blur, or soft focus effects.
- Lumetri Color: This effect allows you to adjust the color and tone of your footage using various tools such as curves, color wheels, HSL secondary, and vignette.
- Sharpen: This effect enhances the edges and details of a layer by increasing the contrast between adjacent pixels.
- Fractal Noise: This effect generates a noise pattern based on fractal mathematics. It can be used to create clouds, fire, smoke, water, or other organic effects.
- Glow: This effect creates a glowing halo around the bright areas of a layer. It can be used to simulate light sources, neon signs, or magic effects.

You can apply these effects to any layer in your composition and adjust their settings in the Effect Controls panel. You can also use masks, track mattes, blending modes, and expressions to control how the effects interact with other layers.
 
To enable GPU acceleration for these effects, you need to have a compatible graphics card and driver installed on your computer. You can check the system requirements and the list of supported cards here: [https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/system-requirements.html](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/system-requirements.html)
 
You can also choose which GPU to use for rendering in the Project Settings dialog box. To access it, go to File > Project Settings and click on the Video Rendering and Effects tab. Under Use, select Mercury GPU Acceleration (CUDA) or Mercury GPU Acceleration (OpenCL) depending on your card type.
