## The History of Magyar Mulatos Zene
 
Magyar mulatos zene has a long and complex history that spans several centuries and regions. It is not easy to pinpoint the exact origin and evolution of this genre, as it has been influenced by various musical traditions and social changes. However, some of the main historical milestones and factors that shaped magyar mulatos zene are:
 
- The role of gypsy musicians in Hungarian culture. Gypsies, or Roma, have been living in Hungary since the 14th century, and they have contributed significantly to the musical life of the country. They have been playing folk music, classical music, and popular music for different audiences and occasions, adapting their style and repertoire to the demand and taste of their listeners. They have also developed their own musical language and expression, based on improvisation, ornamentation, virtuosity, and emotion. Gypsy music has been a major source of inspiration and innovation for magyar mulatos zene, especially in terms of instrumentation, rhythm, melody, and harmony.
- The emergence of nÃ³ta in the 19th century. NÃ³ta is a type of sentimental song that originated in Budapest in the early 1800s. It was composed by urban musicians who combined elements of Hungarian folk music, gypsy music, Viennese operetta, and Italian opera. NÃ³ta became very popular among the middle and lower classes of Budapest, who enjoyed listening to these songs in cafÃ©s, taverns, theaters, and salons. NÃ³ta also spread to the countryside and other regions of Hungary, where it was performed by local musicians with their own variations and additions. NÃ³ta is one of the main components of magyar mulatos zene, as it provides many of the songs and melodies that are played at parties.
- The influence of foreign musical styles in the 20th century. Magyar mulatos zene has always been open to incorporating new musical influences from abroad, especially from neighboring countries and Western Europe. Some of the foreign musical styles that have left their mark on magyar mulatos zene are: jazz, swing, rock and roll, pop, disco, techno, reggae, salsa, and others. These styles have enriched magyar mulatos zene with new rhythms, sounds, instruments, and genres. For example, jazz introduced the saxophone and the clarinet to magyar mulatos zene; rock and roll brought the electric guitar and the keyboard; disco added synthesizers and drum machines; reggae infused a Caribbean flavor; salsa added Latin percussion; and so on.
- The rise of muskÃ¡tlizene in Yugoslavia in the 1980s. MuskÃ¡tlizene (literally "geranium music") is a term that refers to a wave of magyar mulatos zene albums that were produced and released in Yugoslavia in the 1980s. These albums were mainly recorded by Hungarian musicians from Vojvodina (a region in northern Serbia with a large Hungarian minority), who took advantage of the more liberal market conditions and media exposure in Yugoslavia compared to Hungary at that time. MuskÃ¡tlizene albums featured modernized versions of traditional magyar mulatos zene songs, as well as original compositions influenced by contemporary pop music. MuskÃ¡tlizene became a huge success not only in Yugoslavia but also in Hungary, where it sparked a revival and transformation of magyar mulatos zene. One of the most famous and influential muskÃ¡tlizene bands was 3+2[^1^], whose debut album HalvÃ¡ny Åszi rÃ³zsa (Pale Autumn Rose) sold more than 330 thousand copies in three months in 1986[^1^].

Magyar mulatos zene is a dynamic and diverse music genre that reflects the history and culture of Hungary and its people. It is a music that celebrates life, love, joy, humor, nostalgia, and identity. It is a music that connects generations, regions, communities, and nations.
