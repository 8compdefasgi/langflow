A no-CD crack is a modified version of the game's executable file that bypasses the CD check and allows you to run the game without the original disc. This is not illegal if you own a legitimate copy of the game and only use it for personal purposes. However, you should be careful where you download the no-CD crack from, as some websites may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer.
  
In this article, we will show you how to find and install a no-CD crack for Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 Deluxe Edition on Windows 64-bit systems. Follow these steps:
  
1. First, you need to have Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 Deluxe Edition installed on your computer. This includes the base game and the two expansion packs: Soaked! and Wild!. You can buy the game from Steam or other online platforms, or use your original CD if you still have it.
2. Next, you need to download a no-CD crack that matches your game version. You can search for it on Google using keywords like "Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 Deluxe Edition No Cd Crack 64". You should find several websites that offer the file, such as GameCopyWorld or GameBurnWorld. Make sure to read the comments and reviews before downloading anything, and scan the file with an antivirus program before opening it.
3. Once you have downloaded the no-CD crack, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should see a file named RCT3.exe or something similar. This is the modified executable file that will replace the original one.
4. Now, you need to locate your game installation folder. The default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Atari\Rollercoaster Tycoon 3. If you installed the game somewhere else, you can find it by right-clicking on the game shortcut and choosing Properties > Open File Location.
5. Before you overwrite anything, make a backup copy of your original RCT3.exe file. You can do this by copying and pasting it to another folder, or renaming it to something like RCT3\_old.exe. This way, you can restore it if something goes wrong.
6. Finally, copy and paste the no-CD crack file (RCT3.exe) into your game installation folder. You may need to confirm that you want to replace the existing file. Once you do that, you are done. You can now launch the game without needing a CD.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed a no-CD crack for Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 Deluxe Edition on your Windows 64-bit system. Now you can enjoy building your dream theme park without any hassle. Have fun!
