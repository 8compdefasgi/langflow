Some of the reviews of the movie are as follows:

> "Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara is not an absolute washout though. Far from it. (...) The lasting impression though is of a sliver of a project, not a fully fleshed out film." - Anna M.M. Vetticad, annavetticadgoes2themovies

> "After all the shoot-outs and bang-bangs are over, you are left with a film which leaves you with so little new that you wonder if there's any juice left in this style of retro gangsta flick." - Shubhra Gupta, The Indian Express

> "Once the movie becomes a slackly-paced love triangle, it suffers from how badly the character of Jasmine is written." - Danny Bowes, RogerEbert.com

> "This is a love story of a gangsta, it does not reopen donsâ crime diaries. The first part is more engaging; thereon, the sluggish pace lacks the same dum." - Times of India
